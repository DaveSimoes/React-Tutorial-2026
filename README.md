## 🌐 Documentation Website

This repository includes an English documentation website in `docs/` designed for community learning from beginner to advanced React topics, including React 2026 trends and a built-in light/dark mode toggle.

To preview locally:

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

To generate a deploy-ready folder for Netlify:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates `dist/` with the full static documentation site, so you can deploy with:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```
